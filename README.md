# Two-dimensional-elliptic-PDE-finite-difference-method-visualization
This programme is for mathematical software 4th homework. The requirement is below:

---
A and B are the largest and second largest Numbers in your student id.The finite difference method is used to solve the elliptic PDE equations. The equations are in figure1.

This problem belongs to two - dimensional two - point boundary value problem. The main idea is to replace the derivative with a difference quotient in each direction. The interval is segmented and Taylor expansion is performed. Matlab left division method was used to solve the formula, the row vector was obtained and brought back to the original equation, and finally plot function was used to draw the graph.

After running this code, you are able to get a plot like figure 2.

I am glad if my code can help you~
