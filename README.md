# Two-dimensional-elliptic-PDE-finite-difference-method-visualization
This programme is for mathematical software 4th homework. The requirement is below:
---
A and B are the largest and second largest Numbers in your student id.The finite difference method is used to solve the elliptic PDE equations. The equations are in figure1.

After running this code, you are able to get a plot like figure 2.

----
I am glad if my code can help you~
